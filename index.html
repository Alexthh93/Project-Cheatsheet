            <p>
                By applying these unique identifiers we boost the search engines chances of priotizing our page
                since <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> isn't specific enough compared to an <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong> when someone searches after blog, <br>
                or anything related with information. Using <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> helps when someone searches for address, since 
                <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> has more value and is more specific, to address, names, nr etc than pure <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong>tag.
