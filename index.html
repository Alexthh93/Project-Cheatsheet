                someone not taking advantages of correct semantic setup, would at the long run,
                be in for a lot of extra working hours. <br> Semantic rules applied correct, wont
                just help making both HTML, as CSS code more readable, but also makes the working
                process more available and easy for anyone who would come across, to <br> either work on,
                or continuing the current HTML or CSS files.

            <!-- Ending words of Semantic article section -->
            <p>
                By applying these unique identifiers we boost the search engines chances of priotizing our page
                since <strong class='html-tag'>&lt;div&gt;</strong> isn't specific enough compared to an <strong class='html-tag'>&lt;article&gt;</strong> when someone searches after blog, <br>
                or anything related with information. Using <strong class='html-tag'>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> helps when someone searches for address, since 
                <strong class='html-tag'>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> has more value and is more specific, to address, names, nr etc than pure <strong class='html-tag'>&lt;div&gt;</strong> tag.

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>
                CSS, also known as Cascading stylesheet, is the colors of the homepage. When we think about a website we need to understand that pure HTML,
                simply sets the skelet of the website, and CSS brings colors and life. By manipulating the selectors, classes or ID's of the HTML files,
                colors, fonts, borders and other creative designed properties can be added, it all depends on ones imagination. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Classes</strong> is most of the type another extension of an HTML element type, we use classes on mostly "articles, sections and footers" etc. 
                That way we can manipualte a big section of the page due to the parents of nested elements on our HTML site. Should we choose to go in further details
                and manipulate childrens of a class type, we add either another class and makes a more described specification of a given design, which 
                we want to bring to life, or we simply give that unique element an <strong>ID class with # hashtag sign</strong>.
