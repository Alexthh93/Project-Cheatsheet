# Project-Cheatsheet

A quick Cheatsheet to pass the Codecademy HTML / CSS project. 


## What has been used ?
For this specific project, I've used a table, made sure to describe different elements importance due to SEO. 
when looking through my HTML code one would see a very little usage of class (due to little css manipulation), but still no divs has been used to short down the edditing options on CSS. 
CSS has very few lines, but still made a strong impact due to HTML class sharing.
